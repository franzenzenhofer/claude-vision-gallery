# Claude Vision Gallery

An AI-generated art exhibition showcasing how Claude Code perceives and understands the world through abstract 3D visualizations.

## Concept

This gallery presents a series of Blender-generated 3D artworks that represent different aspects of Claude Code's cognitive processes:
- Pattern recognition and data structures
- System architecture visualization
- Code flow and logic representation
- Network connections and API interactions
- The beauty of clean, efficient algorithms

Each piece is algorithmically generated using Blender's Python API to create unique visual interpretations of computational thinking.
